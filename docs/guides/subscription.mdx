# Subscriptions

Rhino Subscriptions provides recurring billing using the stripe platform.

## Integrating Rhino Subscriptions

Rhino subscriptions can be added by the following steps:

1. Create an account in [Stripe platform](https://stripe.com). Complete setting up the account and make sure the project business name is added [here](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account)
2. Apply the business model as `product` and `prices` on [stripe](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products/create).
3. Get Publishable key and Secret key from Stripe [profile](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys) and use them in ENV variables as `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`.
4. Install Rhino Subscriptions module using this command: `rails rhino_subscriptions:install` then use `rails db:migrate` to complete migration of the newly added model.
5. Check everything is working and/or customize stripe experience.
   To checkout in test mode, use these [test card numbers](https://stripe.com/docs/testing#cards).
6. Change your stripe profile from test mode to live mode and set the live keys in ENV variables.
