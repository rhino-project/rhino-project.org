# Super Admin

This guide describes how to set up a super admin in Rhino.

## Dashboard

Rhino uses the [ActiveAdmin](https://activeadmin.info/) gem to create an admin dashboard. It is a powerful tool that allows you to create a custom admin dashboard for your application.

By default Rhino comes with a basic dashboard that displays all [resources](../concepts/resources/) and allows editing based on the configuration.

### Configuration

The admin dashboard configuration is in `config/initializers/active_admin.rb` and can be altered to the project needs.

## Extending

When the admin dashboard is generated, it will create a model for each resource. You can override the default behavior by creating a new model in the `app/admin` folder. For example, if you want to change the default filters for the `Blog` resource, you can create `app/admin/blog.rb`:

```ruby title="app/admin/blog.rb"
ActiveAdmin.register Blog do
  filter :title
  filter :published
end
```

## Theming

Rhino includes the [arctic_admin](https://github.com/cprodhomme/arctic_admin) theme.

## ActiveAdmin Addons

Rhino include the [activeadmin_addons](https://github.com/platanus/activeadmin_addons) gem to add some extra functionality to ActiveAdmin.

### Optimizing select filters

ActiveAdmin’s default select filter loads all records from the database which can cause significant performance issues. To avoid this, a lazy typeahead select filter can be created using [activeadmin_addons](https://github.com/platanus/activeadmin_addons), and the [Ransack](https://github.com/activerecord-hackery/ransack) gem used by ActiveAdmin.

Imagine we have an InvoiceLineItem table, that belongs to a UsersRole, that in turn belongs to a User. If we want a “User“ filter in the InvoiceLineItem Index page, we would do something like this:

```ruby title="app/admin/invoice_line_items.rb"
ActiveAdmin.register InvoiceLineItem do
  preserve_default_filters!
  remove_filter :users_role # remove original filter
  filter :users_role_user_id, # this name must contain the relationships path from the model from the index page until the user table, so invoice_line_item -> users_role -> user. the engine will do a join.
    label: "User",
    as: :search_select_filter,
    url: proc { admin_users_path }, # AJAX endpoint
    fields: %w[name nickname email], # columns in the looked up table to be compared against
    minimum_input_length: 2,
    method_model: User, # original table
    width: "190px", # necessary for fixing a UI bug
    display_name: "full_nickname_and_email", # custom display name that gives you more flexibility to use whatever you want
    order_by: "name"
end
```

Create a json view for the admin_users_path to return a custom attribute that will be shown in the results select box.

```ruby title="app/views/admin/users/index.json.jbuilder"
json.array!(@users) do |user|
  json.extract! user, :id, :full_nickname_and_email
end
```

Finish up by implementing the custom display field in the User model:

```ruby title="app/models/user.rb"
def full_nickname_and_email
  "#{nickname || name} - #{email}"
end
```

:::info
jbuilder is no longer included in Rhino by default. You will need to add it to your Gemfile.
