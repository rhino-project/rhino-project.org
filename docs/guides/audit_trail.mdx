# Audit Trail

Audit trail support in Rhino is provided by the [paper_trail](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail) gem.

This gem provides a `has_paper_trail` method that can be used to add audit trail support to any model. The gem also provides a `Version` model that is used to store the audit trail data.

## Installation

Installation requires installing the gem, running the generator and running the migrations.

```bash
bundle add paper_trail
rails generate paper_trail:install
rails db:migrate
```

## Enabling

Enabled for a model as follows:

```ruby
class BlogPost < ApplicationRecord
  has_paper_trail
end
```

Rhino will automatically add the current user to the audit trail for API requests.
