# Properties

Properties are generated from attributes on an ActiveRecord model. They are used to define the data model for a resource and are used to generate the API schema, validation, and serialization.

## Restricting properties

Properties on a model can be restricted for reading and or writing in the API.

### Including specific properties

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  rhino_properties_read only: %i[id uid name email]
  rhino_properties_create only: %i[name nickname email]
  rhino_properties_update only: %i[name nickname]
end
```

### Excluding specific properties

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  rhino_properties_read except: %i[password]
end
```

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  rhino_properties_write except: %i[email]
end
```

### Restricting array operations

Array operations for nested properties can be limited by the `rhino_properties_array` method. This can be used disallow creation, update or destruction of array items.

```ruby
accepts_nested_attributes_for :og_meta_tags, allow_destroy: true

# Disallow creation of new og_meta_tags
rhino_properties_array og_meta_tags: { creatable: false, updatable: false, destroyable: false }
```

:::info
The `allow_destroy` option for `accepts_nested_attributes_for` must be set to `true` for the `destroyable` option to work. The `allow_destroy` option is used for the `destroyable` setting by default.
:::

## Overriding default settings

### Specifying a format

A specific format can be set for a property. For example, a phone number can be of type string, but it can be formatted as a phone number in the front end.

```ruby
rhino_properties_format phone: :phone, blog_categories: :join_table_simple
```

### Setting property display name

The readable name is used to label the property in forms, display, filters and more in the front end. By default it is based on the name of the property in the backend. The readable name for one or more properties can be overridden:

```ruby
rhino_properties_readable_name title: "Name", description: "Body"
```

## File attachments

Files can be attached to ActiveRecord models with [Active Storage](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_storage_overview.html) and referenced by referring to the attachment relationship.

```ruby
class BlogPost < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :blog

  has_one_attachment :header_image

  rhino_owner :blog
  rhino_references [:blog, :header_image_attachment]
end
```

or for many attachments:

```ruby
class BlogPost < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :blog

  has_many_attachments :post_image

  rhino_owner :blog
  rhino_references [:blog, :post_image_attachments]
end
```

## Tags

Rhino includes the [acts_as_taggable](https://github.com/mbleigh/acts-as-taggable-on) gem for tagging support. Simply add the `acts_as_taggable_on :tags` to your model and Rhino will automatically add the tags property to the resource.

```ruby
class BlogPost < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :blog

  acts_as_taggable_on :tags

  rhino_owner :blog
  rhino_references %i[blog]
end
```

## Additional formats

Rhino provides additional backend helpers for common formats that can be used to validate the format of a property.

### Country

Use the country validator based on [countries gem](https://github.com/countries/countries) for backend validation. Your model might look something like this:

```ruby
  # Validate the optional country
  validates :country, country: { allow_blank: true }
```

```ruby
  # Validate the required alpha3 country
  validates :country, country: { alpha3: true }
```

### Currency

Use the field as currency in the front end. Your model might look something like this:

```ruby
  # Set the format for the attribute
  rhino_properties_format amount: :currency
```

:::info
Currency should be stored as a decimal type in the database.
:::

### IPv4

Use the ipv4 validator for backend validation. Your model might look something like this:

```ruby
  # Validate the optional country
  validates :ipv4, ipv4: { allow_blank: true }
```

### Mac Address

Use the mac address validator for backend validation. Your model might look something like this:

```ruby
  # Validate the optional country
  validates :mac_address, mac_address: { allow_blank: true }
```

### Phone

Use phonelib for backend validation. It is built based on [Google's libphonenumber](https://github.com/google/libphonenumber) which is the standard for this. Your model might look something like this:

```ruby
  # Set the format for the attribute
  rhino_properties_format phone: :phone

  # Normalize the phone number to e164 format
  before_validation :normalize_phone

  # Validate the phone number is possible (limited check)
  validates :phone, phone: { message: "not a valid phone number", possible: true }

  private
    def normalize_phone
      self.phone = Phonelib.parse(phone).full_e164.presence
    end
```

## Changing Validation Messages

Sometimes you want to rewrite the default validation message for an attribute.

E.g. Let's say you have the following `Customer` model:

```ruby
class Customer < ApplicationRecord
  validates :email, presence: true, email: true, uniqueness: true
end
```

The customer table has `name` and you want to add the `name` to the error message in case the email has already been taken.
Here is how you can achieve that:

```ruby
class Customer < ApplicationRecord
  validates :email, presence: true, email: true, uniqueness: { message: lambda do |object, data|
                                                                            customer = Customer.find_by(email: data[:value])
                                                                            "has already been taken by customer: #{customer.name}"
                                                                          end }
end
```

## Synthetic Attributes

At times you may need to "synthesize" an attribute that is not stored in the database. This is useful for attributes that are derived from other attributes or attributes that are not stored in the database but are needed for display or other purposes.

Because Rhino introspects the attributes for an [ActiveRecord](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html) model in order to provide API responses, standard Rails techniques can be used to define synthetic attributes. For example, the following model defines a `fahrenheit` attribute that is derived from the `celsius` attribute which is stored in the database.

```ruby
class Temperature < ApplicationRecord
  attribute :fahrenheit, :float

  rhino_owner_global

  # Convert the celsius attribute to fahrenheit
  def fahrenheit
    celsius * 9 / 5 + 32
  end

  # Convert the passed in fahrenheit value to celsius and store it in the celsius attribute
  def fahrenheit=
    celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9
  end

  validates :celsius, presence: true
end
```

:::tip
If you are doing a simple conversion and not accepting both as writeable, you may want to consider using [virtual (generated) columns](#virtual-generated-attributes) instead.
:::

### Property manipulations

All normal manipulations of properties are supported.

```ruby
class Temperature < ApplicationRecord
  attribute :fahrenheit, :float

  rhino_owner_global
  # highlight-next-line
  # Only fahrenheit to be set on update, not create
  # highlight-next-line
  rhino_properties_create except: :fahrenheit

  # Convert the celsius attribute to fahrenheit
  def fahrenheit
    celsius * 9 / 5 + 32
  end

  # Convert the passed in fahrenheit value to celsius and store it in the celsius attribute
  def fahrenheit=
    celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9
  end

  validates :celsius, presence: true
end
```

## Generated Columns

Generated columns are similar to synthetic attributes but are stored in the database. Sample migrations:

```ruby
def change
  create_table :temps do |t|
    t.numeric :celsius
    t.virtual :fahrenheit, type: :numeric, as: 'celsius * 9 / 5 + 32', stored: true
  end
end
```

```ruby
def change
  add_column :temps, :fahrenheit, :numeric, as: 'celsius * 9 / 5 + 32', stored: true, virtual: true
end
```

Rhino supports generated columns in the API. The generated column will be included in the API response by default and can be used in filters and sorting.

:::note
Rails does not support virtual (unstored) columns at this time.
:::

## Read Only Attributes

Attributes listed as readonly with [`attr_readonly`](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/ReadonlyAttributes/ClassMethods.html#method-i-attr_readonly) will be used to create a new record but will not be updated on an existing record.

```ruby
class Blog < ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_readonly :title
end
```

Rhino supports read only attributes in the API and will mark them as creatable but not updatable.
