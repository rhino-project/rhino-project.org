# Upgrading

This guide is for projects that were based on Rhino and need to get code updates from Rhino's repositories.

## General idea

The idea behind this process is to have a branch set up to track Rhino repository's main branch and merge it with the existing code whenever needed. In case changes need to be done after the merge, only one commit (after the generated merge commit) is supposed to be added to the history, therefore a rebase and squash is recommended.

## Update Process

#### Add Rhino's repository as a remote named `rhino-project-template`.

```
git remote add rhino-project-template git@github.com:rhino-project/rhino-project-template.git
```

#### Fetch the `v3.0.0-beta.35` tag from Rhino and name it `rhino-project-template-v3.0.0-beta.35` locally:

```
git fetch rhino-project-template v3.0.0-beta.35:rhino-project-template-v3.0.0-beta.35
```

#### Get the latest updates from Rhino's repository

```
git checkout rhino-project-template-v3.0.0-beta.35
```

#### Create a ticket (in Jira, Trello, etc.) just for the update, e.g. `[PROJ-777] Update from rhino-project-template`

#### Create and checkout a new branch just for the update **from the project's `main` branch**

```
git checkout main
git checkout -b task/PROJ-777
```

#### Merge the updated `rhino-project-template-v3.0.0-beta.35` into the newly created branch:

:::danger
Remove `node_modules` before merging otherwise you may encounter https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/4828
:::

```
git merge rhino-project-template-v3.0.0-beta.35
```

Review the [release notes](release_notes) and to test the application to make sure nothing was broken.

### Easy path

If it's all working well and no changes are needed to accommodate the new code from Rhino, just open a PR (probably to main) for the newly created branch.

### Hard path

There will be some cases where changes will need to be made to the existing code to integrate correctly with Rhino. In these cases, you might end up making one or more commits and might want to rebase and squash them. Rhino has a suggestion on how to do this.

By examining `git log` **after** doing the merge command it's possible to see that the last commit is in fact a merge commit:

```
commit 1b4134524d465b02a795d57c3c06de29960352a7
Merge: fa486dd6 62bab999
Author: Person <person@rhino-project.org>
Date:   Mon Jan 10 20:29:39 2022 -0300

    Merge branch 'rhino-project-template-v3.0.0-beta.22' into task/PROJ-777
```

If it's necessary to make changes after the merge, it's recommended to use as git message the name of the task. That way, `git log` would end up with this fix commit as the last one and with the merge commit right after it like so:

```
commit 36676eab4e68e8d3959aee4a8a66a5265882f09f (HEAD -> task/NUB-777)
Author: Person <person@rhino-project.org>
Date:   Tue Jan 11 09:52:37 2022 -0300

    [PROJ-777] Update from rhino-project-template

commit 1b4134524d465b02a795d57c3c06de29960352a7
Merge: fa486dd6 62bab999
Author: Person <person@rhion-project.org>
Date:   Mon Jan 10 20:29:39 2022 -0300

    Merge branch 'rhino-project-template-v3.0.0-beta.35' into task/PROJ-777
```

If that is the state of `git log`, then there isn't anything else to be done and it is recommended to open the PR just like this. However, in case there are more commits and you want to rebase and squash them, you might find the state of `git log` like this:

```
commit 6feb48197a71742803a04af5dac2a2338012356b
Author: Person <person@rhino-project.org>
Date:   Tue Jan 11 09:52:37 2022 -0300

    [PROJ-777] Update from rhino-project-template

commit 1b4134524d465b02a795d57c3c06de29960352a7
Merge: fa486dd6 62bab999
Author: Person <person@rhino-project.org>
Date:   Mon Jan 10 20:29:39 2022 -0300

    Merge branch 'rhino-project-template-v3.0.0-beta.35' into task/PROJ-777
```

Then, you're probably going to need to squash the last 3 commits (i.e. `6feb48197a71742803a04af5dac2a2338012356b`, `abc8a2ba2112f5e03f3ece20c9e35c76c2717196` and `36676eab4e68e8d3959aee4a8a66a5265882f09f`) into one single commit with the message being `[PROJ-777] Update from rhino-project-template`. **It's really important that you keep the merge commit intact**, so you will have to rebase from `1b4134524d465b02a795d57c3c06de29960352a7` (merge commit) and up:

```
git rebase -i 1b4134524d465b02a795d57c3c06de29960352a7
```

This command would not include the merge commit (a.k.a `1b4134524d465b02a795d57c3c06de29960352a7`) in the rebase, but only the commits that came after it. Git will open the interactive rebase process, in which you want to pick the first commit and squash all the others. By saving it, you would see the commit message file, in which you want to leave the actual final commit message (`[PROJ-777] Update from rhino-project-template`) and comment all the other ones.

After the rebase is done, you can just check `git log` again and see that there's only one commit after the merge commit and that is the final commit with the task's message:

```
commit 525333f9c584a5434eda9311b6e44c7382798203
Author: Person <person@rhino-project.org>
Date:   Tue Jan 12 01:12:32 2022 -0300

    [PROJ-777] Update from rhino-project-template

commit 1b4134524d465b02a795d57c3c06de29960352a7
Merge: fa486dd6 62bab999
Author: Person <person@rhino-project.org>
Date:   Mon Jan 10 20:29:39 2022 -0300

    Merge branch 'rhino-project-template-v3.0.0-beta.35' into task/PROJ-777
```

It is expected that the commit hash from `[PROJ-777] Update from rhino-project-template` just changes, as that's exactly what `git rebase` does - re-writes the history.

Finally, you can open the PR.
