# Website scraping

This guide describes how to scrape import data from web pages.

## Fetching

Use the `faraday` gem https://github.com/lostisland/faraday to fetch. It is the basis of many third party API libraries and provides convenient wrappers around many network libraries (net_http by default) and may already be installed.

Useful middleware gems for scraping include:

- Following redirects: https://github.com/tisba/faraday-follow-redirects
- Retrying: https://github.com/lostisland/faraday-retry
- Submitting form data: https://lostisland.github.io/faraday/middleware/url-encoded

## Parsing

Use the `Nokogiri` gem https://nokogiri.org/ to parse HTML. You can use [xpath and css selectors](https://nokogiri.org/#parsing-and-querying) to extract data.
