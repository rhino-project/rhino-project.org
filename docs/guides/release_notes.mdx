# Release Notes

## 2.3.0

The key changes in this release are:

- Case insensitive sorting for ModelFilterReference
- JSX components path for filters

## 2.2.0

The key changes in this release are:

- Filters are now based on react-hook-form and support devtools for debugging
- Float and Year filters has been added
- Model Integer and Model Float filters now support minimum and and maximum values (and exclusiveMinimum and exclusiveMaximum)
- Separate filters for globally owned models (ModelFilterReference) and non-globally owned models (ModelFilterOwnerReference)

All of the above changes should be backwards compatible unless you have created any custom filters. In that case you will need to update them to use react-hook-form.

## 2.1.0

The key changes in this release are:

- Model has been simplified
- Data acess and query hook arguments have been updated to be more explicit and easier to use.
- react-hook-form is now included as a dependency and used for the authentication forms (sign in, sign up, forgot password, reset password)
  - More support for this will be added in future releases

See below for more details.

### Model fetching

#### Passing to API query and mutation hooks

Historically `getModel` was used to fetch a model object and then pass it too an API hook, but this is no longer necessary as the hooks will create a memoized model object for you and also return it.

```jsx
const { data } = useModelShow(getModel("warehouse"), resource.warehouse.id);
```

becomes:

```jsx
const { data } = useModelShow("warehouse", resource.warehouse.id);
```

and if you need the model object:

```jsx
const { data, model: warehouseModel } = useModelShow(
  "warehouse",
  resource.warehouse.id
);
```

#### Other uses

In some cases the model object was used for other purposes, for instance to construct a URL. In this case the `getModel` function may have been used directly and possibly memoized. The `useModel` hook can be used to achieve the same result:

```jsx
const model = useMemo(() => getModel("warehouse"), []);
```

becomes:

```jsx
const model = useModel("warehouse");
```

useModel will handle the case where the model is already an object and will return it directly in that case already memoized.

```jsx
const MyComponent = ({ model }) => {
  const componentModel = useModel(model);
  const { data } = useModelShow(componentModel, resource.warehouse.id);
};
```

### Model query hook arguments

In general the hooks are backwards compatible with older arguments styles, but it is recommended to migrate to the new format. Here are a list of patterns that can be migrated with 2.1.0.

Previous versions of the hooks the second parameter of the index hook to pass options to the network call which created the query params for filtering, limit, offset, order, search and also used the third parameter to pass options to react query. A more explicit API has been introduced filtering, limit, offset, order, search and the options for react query are now passed as a named object in the second parameter..

```jsx
const { data } = useModelIndex(
  "users_role",
  {
    params: {
      filter: { user_id: user.id },
    },
  },
  { enabled: false }
);
```

becomes:

```jsx
const { data } = useModelIndex("users_role", {
  filter: { user_id: user.id },
  queryOptions: { enabled: false },
});
```

#### networkOptions

Previous versions of the also allowed used a `networkOptions` object to pass parameters to the network call which created the sear. This has been replaced with a more explicit API.

```jsx
const { data } = useModelIndex("users_role", {
  networkOptions: {
    params: {
      filter: { user_id: user.id },
    },
  },
});
```

```jsx
const { data } = useModelIndex(model, {
  filter: { user_id: user.id },
});
```

### Model hook data access

Previous versions of the hooks used the `data` property of the react query response to access the data. This data propery contained the full axios response including things like `header`. The body of an axios response is in the `data` property and so there were many `data.data` style access. The data is now directly available in the `data` property of the query responses:

```jsx
const { data: { data: { results = [] } = {} } = {} } = useModelIndex(
    'users_role',
    filter: { user: loggedInUserId }
  );
```

becomes:

```jsx
const { data: { results = [] } = {} } = useModelIndex(
    'users_role',
    filter: { user: loggedInUserId }
  );
```

similarly for useModelShow:

```jsx
const { data: { data: resource } = {} } = useModelShow(
  "warehouse",
  warehouseId
);
```

becomes:

```jsx
const { resource } = useModelShow("warehouse", warehouseId);
```

and in the callbacks of the mutation hooks:

```jsx
const { mutate } = useModelCreate("warehouse", {
  onSuccess: (data) =>
    history.push(`/warehouses/${data.data.id}`);
});
```

becomes:

```jsx
const { mutate } = useModelCreate("warehouse", {
  onSuccess: (newWarehouse) =>
    history.push(`/warehouses/${newWarehouse.id}`);
});
```

### useModelIndex data helpers

There are also now direct accessors for the resources, results and total count in useModelIndex:

```jsx
const { data: { data: { results = [] } = {} } = {} } = useModelIndex(
    'users_role',
    filter: { user: loggedInUserId }
  );
```

```jsx
const { resources, results = [], total } = useModelIndex(
    'users_role',
    filter: { user: loggedInUserId }
  );
```
