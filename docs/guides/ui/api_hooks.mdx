# API Hooks

This guide is an introduction to the various hooks availble for accessing the api in the front end.

## Hooks and API requests

[Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) are a core piece of React provide a useful set of primitives for reusing logic across components.

API requests in Rhino use [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) for networking and [react-query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) to provide a robust asynchronous cache.

## Making API calls

Rhino provides five common hooks to match the five common CRUD actions, two for reading/querying data:

- useModelShow
- useModelIndex

and three for altering/mutating data:

- useModelCreate
- useModelUpdate
- useModelDestroy

## API Query Hooks

useModelShow and useModelIndex are built on top of [useQuery](https://react-query.tanstack.com/reference/useQuery) and return everything that this hook does.

### useModelShow

useModelShow takes 3 arguments:

```jsx
const { resource } = useModelShow(model, id, options);
```

- `model` a string for the model name or an already existing model object (from useModel or getModel)
- `id` a value for the id of the object to fetch (omitted or null for singular models)
- `options`
  - `networkOptions` a set of options passed to axios
  - `queryOptions` a set of options pased to useQuery (for instance to set the `enabled` option)

and in additon to the [useQuery](https://react-query.tanstack.com/reference/useQuery) returns, useModelShow returns:

- `model` a memoized model used to construct the query
- `resource` a memoized copy of the model (or null if not yet available)

### useModelIndex

useModelIndex takes 2 arguments:

```jsx
const { resources } = useModelIndex(model, options);
```

- `model` a string for the model name or an already existing model object (from useModel or getModel)
- `options`
  - `search` a string for full text search (of fields configured server side)
  - `filter` an object representing a set of filters See [Rest API Filtering](../../concepts/rest_api/filtering)
  - `order` a string resprenting the sort order
  - `limit` a number representing the maximum number of results
  - `offset` a number representing the start of the results
  - `networkOptions` a set of options passed to axios
  - `queryOptions` a set of options pased to useQuery (for instance to set the `enabled` option)

and in additon to the [useQuery](https://react-query.tanstack.com/reference/useQuery) returns, useModelIndex returns:

- `model` a memoized model used to construct the query
- `resources` a memoized copy the model list object from the api with results and total (resources.results, resources.total) (or null if not yet available)
- `results` a memoized copy of results (or null if not yet available)
- `total` a memoized copy of total - the total number of matching objects regardless of pagination (or null if not yet available)

#### Recipes

##### Passing query modifiers

```jsx
const { resources } = useModelIndex(model, {
  search: 'Test'
  filter: {
    published: true,
  },
  order: 'name',
  limit: 10,
  offset: 10
});
```

##### Disabling a Query

```jsx
const { resources } = useModelIndex(model, {
  queryOptions: { enabled: !!user },
});
```

See also: [Dependent Queries](https://react-query.tanstack.com/guides/dependent-queries#_top)

##### Refreshing More Frequently

```jsx
const { resources } = useModelIndex(model, {
  queryOptions: { refetchInterval: 15 * 1000 },
});
```

### Checking status

It may be tempting to do something like:

```jsx

const { resource } = useModelShow('blog', 23);

if (!resource) return <Spinner>;
```

but it is better to rely on the status checks in react-query:

```jsx
const { isSuccess, resource } = useModelShow('blog', 23);

if (!isSuccess) return <Spinner>;
```

## API Mutation Hooks

useModelCreate, useModelUpdate and useModelDestroy are built on top of [useMutation](https://react-query.tanstack.com/reference/useMutation) and return everything that this hook does.

The API also returns the object in its form post-mutation so you can react to the new state.

### useModelCreate

useModelCreate takes 2 arguments:

```jsx
const { mutation } = useModelCreate(model, mutationOptions);
```

- `model` a string for the model name or an already existing model object (from useModel or getModel)
- `mutationOptions` a set of options pased to useMutation (for instance to set the `enabled` option)

and in additon to the [[useMutation](https://react-query.tanstack.com/reference/useMutation) returns, useModelCreate returns:

- `model` a memoized model used to construct the query
- `resource` a memoized copy of the model (or null if not yet available)

#### Recipes

##### Acting On Success

```jsx
const { mutate } = useModelCreate("blog_post");

const handleCreate = () => mutate({name "test"}, {onSuccess: (blogPost) => console.log("Created id", blogPost.id)})
```

### useModelUpdate

useModelUpdate takes 2 arguments:

```jsx
const { mutation } = useModelUpdate(model, mutationOptions);
```

- `model` a string for the model name or an already existing model object (from useModel or getModel)
- `mutationOptions` a set of options pased to useMutation (for instance to set the `enabled` option)

and in additon to the [useMutation](https://react-query.tanstack.com/reference/useMutation) returns, useModelUpdate returns:

- `model` a memoized model used to construct the query
- `resource` a memoized copy of the model (or null if not yet available)

When calling the mutation:

```jsx
const { mutate } = useModelUpdate("blog_post");

const handleSave = () => mutate({id: 4, name "test"})
```

the object passed to mutate _must_ contain and id field.

#### Recipes

##### Acting On Success

```jsx
const { mutate } = useModelUpdate("blog_post");

const handleSave = () => mutate({id: 4, name "test"}, {onSuccess: (blogPost) => console.log("Updated name to", blogPost.name)})
```

### useModelDestroy

useModelDestroy takes 2 arguments:

```jsx
const { mutation } = useModelDestroy(model, mutationOptions);
```

- `model` a string for the model name or an already existing model object (from useModel or getModel)
- `mutationOptions` a set of options pased to useMutation (for instance to set the `enabled` option)

and in additon to the [useMutation](https://react-query.tanstack.com/reference/useMutation) returns, useModelDestroy returns:

- `model` a memoized model used to construct the query
- `resource` a memoized copy of the model (or null if not yet available)

When calling the mutation:

```jsx
const { mutate } = useModelDestroy("blog_post");

const handleDelete = () => mutate({ id: 4 });
```

the object passed to mutate _must_ contain and id field.

#### Recipes

##### Acting On Success

```jsx
const { mutate } = useModelDestroy("blog_post");

const handleDelete = () =>
  mutate(
    { id: 4 },
    {
      onSuccess: (blogPost) =>
        console.log("Destroyed object with name", blogPost.name),
    }
  );
```

## Building Custom Hooks

The built in CRUD hooks themselves are composed of several lower level hooks, all of which can be re-used to build your own more customized hooks, for instance:

```jsx
export const usePublishedBlogPosts = () => {
  return useModelIndex("blog_post", {
    filter: {
      published: true,
    },
  });
};
```

## Legacy Migration

In general the hooks support older parameter formats, but it is recommended to migrate to the new format. Here are a list of patterns that can be migrated:

### getModel

#### Passing to API query and mutation hooks

Historically getModel was used to fetch a model object and then pass it too an API hook, but this is no longer necessary as the hooks will create a memoized model object for you and also return it.

```jsx
const { data } = useModelShow(getModel("warehouse"), resource.warehouse.id);
```

becomes:

```jsx
const { data } = useModelShow("warehouse", resource.warehouse.id);
```

and if you need the model object:

```jsx
const { data, model: warehouseModel } = useModelShow(
  "warehouse",
  resource.warehouse.id
);
```

#### Using the model for other purposes

In some cases the model object was used for other purposes, for instance to construct a URL. In this case the `getModel` function may have been used directly and possibly memoized. The `useModel` hook can be used to achieve the same result:

```jsx
const model = useMemo(() => getModel("warehouse"), []);
```

becomes:

```jsx
const model = useModel("warehouse");
```

useModel will handle the case where the model is already an object and will return it directly in that case already memoized.

```jsx
const MyComponent = ({ model }) => {
  const componentModel = useModel(model);
  const { data } = useModelShow(componentModel, resource.warehouse.id);
};
```

### Direct network and query options

Previous versions of the hooks the second parameter of the index hook to pass options to the network call which created the query params for filtering, limit, offset, order, search and also used the third parameter to pass options to react query. A more explicit API has been introduced filtering, limit, offset, order, search and the options for react query are now passed as a named object in the second parameter..

```jsx
const { data } = useModelIndex(
  "users_role",
  {
    params: {
      filter: { user_id: user.id },
    },
  },
  { enabled: false }
);
```

becomes:

```jsx
const { data } = useModelIndex("users_role", {
  filter: { user_id: user.id },
  queryOptions: { enabled: false },
});
```

### networkOptions

Previous versions of the also allowed used a `networkOptions` object to pass parameters to the network call which created the sear. This has been replaced with a more explicit API.

```jsx
const { data } = useModelIndex("users_role", {
  networkOptions: {
    params: {
      filter: { user_id: user.id },
    },
  },
});
```

```jsx
const { data } = useModelIndex(model, {
  filter: { user_id: user.id },
});
```

### Data access

Previous versions of the hooks used the `data` property of the react query response to access the data. This data propery contained the full axios response including things like `header`. The body of an axios response is in the `data` property and so there were many `data.data` style access. The data is now directly available:

```jsx
const { data: { data: { results = [] } = {} } = {} } = useModelIndex(
    'users_role',
    filter: { user: loggedInUserId }
  );
```

becomes:

```jsx
const { data: { results = [] } = {} } = useModelIndex(
    'users_role',
    filter: { user: loggedInUserId }
  );
```

similarly for useModelShow:

```jsx
const { data: { data: resource } = {} } = useModelShow(
  "warehouse",
  warehouseId
);
```

becomes:

```jsx
const { resource } = useModelShow("warehouse", warehouseId);
```

#### Simplified data access

There are also now direct accessors for the resources, results and total count:

```jsx
const { data: { data: { results = [] } = {} } = {} } = useModelIndex(
    'users_role',
    filter: { user: loggedInUserId }
  );
```

```jsx
const { results = [], total } = useModelIndex(
    'users_role',
    filter: { user: loggedInUserId }
  );
```
