# Edit page

The edit page is for editing a single record of a model. It is the page that is shown when you click on the "Edit" button in the show page. The component structure of the edit page is as follows:

```mermaid
graph TB
    ModelEdit-->ModelEditHeader
    ModelEdit-->ModelEditForm
    ModelEdit-->ModelEditActions
    ModelEditForm-->ModelForm
    ModelEditActions-->ModelActions
```

## Changing the editable fields

```javascript
const rhinoConfig = {
  version: 1,
  components: {
    create: {
      ModelEdit: {
        props: {
          paths: ["title", "published_at"],
        },
      },
    },
  },
};
```
