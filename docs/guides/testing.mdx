# Testing

## Backend

Rhino uses minitest for all testing on the backend. The tests are located in the `test` directory. By default the tests will run with parallel workers. Set the `PARALLEL_WORKERS` environment variable to 1 to run the tests in serial.

Read more on [testing](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html) in Rails.

### Running tests

All tests can be run with the following command:

```bash
rails test
```

run a single test file:

```bash
rails test test/models/user_test.rb
```

run a single test (`:5` indicates the line number the test starts on)

```bash
rails test test/models/user_test.rb:5
```

### Debugging tests

The `debugger` gem is included in Rhino. To use it, add the following to your test:

```ruby
require "test_helper"

class CurrencyTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  test "currency should be created" do
    # highlight-next-line
    debugger
    assert Currency.new(name: "currency", code: "code").valid?
  end
end
```

Then run the tests with the following command so that they do not run in parallel:

```bash
PARALLEL_WORKERS=1 rails test test/models/user_test.rb
```

### Test Data

Rhino can use built-in Rails fixtures and also provides [FactoryBot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot) in combination with [FFaker](https://github.com/ffaker/ffaker) for generating test data. FactoryBot is configured to use the `test/factories` directory.

:::tip
Often models require unique data for attributes. FFaker provides a `unique` method to ensure that the data is unique. `FFaker::Name.unique.name`

### Mock third-party APIs

The `webmock` gem is included in Rhino. To use it, and mock third-party APIs add the following to your test:

```ruby
require "test_helper"
require "webmock/minitest"

class CurrencyTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  test "currency should be created" do
    stub_request(:get, "https://api.example.com/customer-id/")
      .to_return(status: 200, body: { id: 1 }.to_json, headers: {})
    uri = URI("https://api.example.com/customer-id/")
    response = Net::HTTP.get_response(uri)
    data = JSON.parse(response.body)
    assert_equal data["id"], 1
  end
end
```

## Frontend

### Unit and Component Testing

Rhino uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) for unit and component testing on the frontend. Background on this philosophy is here:

- https://kentcdodds.com/blog/making-your-ui-tests-resilient-to-change
- https://kentcdodds.com/blog/testing-implementation-details
- https://medium.com/flatiron-labs/testing-async-react-hooks-6a4d0ce2654c

The tests are located in the `app/frontend/__tests__` directory.

#### Running tests

All tests can be run with the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

### E2E Testing

Rhino uses Cypress for E2E testing. The tests are located in the `cypress/integration` directory. Cypress can be loaded with the following command:

```bash
npm run cypress:open
```

or all tests can be executed on the command line with:

```bash
npm run cypress:run
```

#### Recording CI Runs

Cypress can be configured to record runs on Cypress Cloud. To do this, set the `CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY` and `CYPRESS_PROJECT_ID` environment variables in CircleCI -> Environment Variables -> Project Settings.
