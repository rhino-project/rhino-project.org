# Testing

## Backend

Rhino uses minitest for all testing on the backend. The tests are located in the `test` directory. By default the tests will run with parallel workers. Set the `PARALLEL_WORKERS` environment variable to 1 to run the tests in serial.

Read more on [testing](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html) in Rails.

### Running tests

All tests can be run with the following command:

```bash
rails test
```

run a single test file:

```bash
rails test test/models/user_test.rb
```

run a single test (`:5` indicates the line number the test starts on)

```bash
rails test test/models/user_test.rb:5
```

### Debugging tests

The `debugger` gem is included in Rhino. To use it, add the following to your test:

```ruby
require "test_helper"

class CurrencyTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
  test "currency should be created" do
    # highlight-next-line
    debugger
    assert Currency.new(name: "currency", code: "code").valid?
  end
end
```

Then run the tests with the following command so that they do not run in parallel:

```bash
PARALLEL_WORKERS=1 rails test test/models/user_test.rb
```

## Frontend

Rhino uses Jest for unit and component testing on the frontend. The tests are located in the `src/__tests__` directory.

### Running tests

All tests can be run with the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```

## E2E Testing

Rhino uses Cypress for E2E testing. The tests are located in the `cypress/integration` directory. Cypress can be loaded with the following command:

```bash
npm run cypress:open
```

or all tests can be executed on the command line with:

```bash
npm run cypress:run
```
