# For Server (Rails)

Backend applications generally are easy to set up error reporting tools, as they generally have to deal with minification, obfuscation, etc.

## Making it work

The **only** environment variable **necessary to make Rollbar work** is `ROLLBAR_ACCESS_TOKEN`, that can be found in the `env.sample` file. By default, Rollbar will not work if there's no access token set, but neither will it break the application.

The following snippet is present in `config/initializers/rollbar.rb` will make sure it doesn't run on development or test environments:

```ruby title="config/initializers/rollbar.rb"
  config.enabled = false if Rails.env.test? || Rails.env.development? || config.access_token.blank?
```
