Rhino provides a dev tool to help you develop and debug your application. It is available in the upper right corner of the application. When you click on the icon, it will open the dev tool on top of the application. You can close it by clicking on the close icon in the upper right corner of the dev tool.

You are provided with information on the model being displayed and context specific information for the controller (Index, Show, Edit, Create).
