# REST API

The Rhino REST API is generated from the [resource](../resources) definitions in the application.

A description of the API is available at /api/info/models, for instance:
http://localhost:3002/api/info/models

This is the output the description of all resources.

## Controllers

By default Resources will use the default controller for Resources, Rhino::CrudController,, but this can be altered

```ruby
class Blog < ApplicationRecord
  rhino_controller :simple
end
```

### Built In Controllers

#### Rhino::BaseController

> Base for others to inherit from that provides basic initialization, error handling, pundit and cors

#### Rhino::CrudController

> Provides basic CRUD actions (index, show, create, update, destroy) and enforces policy authorization, scoping and parameratization as well as sieve support

#### Rhino::SimpleController

> Maps an action to a method on the Resource itself. Enforces policy authorization but nothing else.

## Parameters

Parameters are what is accepted or returned from the API as properties for the Resource. Parameters by default reflect the properties of a resource, but can be overwritten by the resource itself or policies.

#### Reference parameters

Importantly references are returned as an embedded object of a resource, directly in the case of a one relationship and in an array in the case of a many relationship. For instance:

```javascript
// BlogPost
{
  id: 323,
  title: "My post",
  blog: {
    id: 6,
    name: "Super Blog"
  }
}
```

However when setting a reference parameter, use the identifier property (ie the foreign key) as the parameter.

```javascript
// BlogPost
{
  id: 323,
  title: "My post",
  blog: 7
}
```

### Nested support

Resources with many references resources can accepted "nested" . With active record based resources this is handled automatically if [`accepts_nested_attributes_for`](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/NestedAttributes/ClassMethods.html) is configured on the model.

### Properties vs Parameters

Properties are part of the data model of the Resource, while parameters are what the REST API will accept and return for a Resource. They can be different.

## Sieves

Querying resources on index API endpoints is implemented with sieves. Sieves are an ordered stack of actions applied based on URL parameters.

There is a default set of sieves, but they can be altered on a per resource basis. For instance this:

```ruby
class Blog < ApplicationRecord
  rhino_sieves.swap Rhino::Sieve::Limit, Rhino::Sieve::Limit, default_limit: nil
end
```

would remove the default limit of 10 from the index endpoint for blogs.

### Rhino::Sieve::Filter

> Filter based on properties, including properties of referenced resources [read more](./filtering).

### Rhino::Sieve::Limit

> Limit the number of resources returned - useful for pagination [read more](./pagination).

### Rhino::Sieve::Offset

> Offset from start of the results - useful for pagination [read more](./pagination).

### Rhino::Sieve::Order

> Sorting of the results [read more](./sorting).

### Rhino::Sieve::Search
