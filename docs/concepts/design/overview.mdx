# Overview

Rhino uses Bootstrap as UI library. You can find the documentation [here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/).

## Design System

While Rhino doesn't have its own Design System structure, the recommended approach is to use one of these Figma files as a base for your design:

- [Bootstrap 5 UI Kit by @jituchauhan](<https://www.figma.com/file/WXf3PInyGlRh7BIDb5TWvG/Bootstrap-UI-Kit-(Community)?type=design&t=ukVg852L5ZaoiGFG-6>)
- [Bootstrap 5 Design System by Vinh Bui](<https://www.figma.com/file/9jmCpP4JzEjAgAptQiPQaK/Bootstrap-5-Design-System---UI-Kit-(Community)?type=design&t=ukVg852L5ZaoiGFG-6>)

### Icons

Rhino includes [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/) by default
