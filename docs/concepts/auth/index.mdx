# Overview

This guide is an introduction to Rhino Authentication

## Authentication

Authentication in Rhino uses devise_token_auth which itself is built on devise. Omniauth is used for 3rd party authentication via OAuth2.

### OmniAuth OAuth2 Providers

By default, Rhino comes with the following OmniAuth OAuth2 providers:

- Microsoft - [omniauth-azure-activedirectory-v2](https://github.com/RIPAGlobal/omniauth-azure-activedirectory-v2)
- Auth0 - [omniauth-auth0](https://github.com/auth0/omniauth-auth0)
- Facebook - [omniauth-facebook](https://github.com/simi/omniauth-facebook)
- Github - [omniauth-github](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth)
- Google -[omniauth-google-oauth2](https://github.com/zquestz/omniauth-google-oauth2)
- Developer - for testing purposes

Configure the specific provider with the callback: `<host>/api/auth/omniauth/google_oauth2/callback` for instance `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/omniauth/google_oauth2/callback` in developent.

Add environment variables for the strategy, `AUTH_<UPPER CASE STRATEGY>_CLIENT_ID`, `AUTH_<UPPER CASE STRATEGY>_SECRET_KEY`, for example:

```
AUTH_FACEBOOK_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
AUTH_FACEBOOK_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
```

The oauth modules will then be advertised as part of the rhino open api response.

```json
"info": {
  "title": "Rhino Template",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "x-rhino-info": {
    "version": "0.21.0.beta.17",
    "authOwner": "user",
    "baseOwner": "user",
    "oauth": [
      "google_oauth2",
      "github",
      "developer"
    ],
    "modules": {
    }
  }
```

#### Google

https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials and set up "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs".

Callback will be `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/omniauth/google_oauth2/callback` for development.

Environment variables:

```
AUTH_GOOGLE_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
AUTH_GOOGLE_OAUTH2_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
```

#### Github

https://github.com/settings/developers and do "New OAuth App"

Callback will be `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/omniauth/github/callback` for development.

#### Microsoft Azure

You need to register a new app in your tenant Azure Active Directory. For this go to your [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/?quickstart=True#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/RegisteredApps) and click on “App registration” and on “New registration”.

Then you may fill 4 things and click to Register:

- Your app name
- Set supported account types option to "Multi tenant”
- Redirect URI to “Web” and callback to `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/omniauth/azure_oauth2/callback`
- Frontend-channel logout URL to `https://localhost:3000/api/auth/sign_out`

From this setup you can retrieve the .env variable values for:

Environment variables:

```
AUTH_AZURE_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
AUTH_AZURE_OAUTH2_SECRET_KEY=(to find this one, grab the 'value' field instead of SECRET_ID in 'Credentials & secrets.')
```

:::tip
You can support a single tenant by setting the supported account types option to "Ssingle tenant” and setting

```
AUTH_AZURE_OAUTH2_TENANT_ID=your_tenant_id
```

## Cookies

Rhino Client's authentication system is based on httponly cookies, issued by the server, and therefore not accessible via javascript.

### First-party vs Third-party cookies

Browsers differentiate these two types of cookies by analyzing who issued the cookie. Basically, if the cookie was issued by a server in the same domain, it's considered to be a first-party cookie, even if client and server live in different subdomains. For instance, a browser running `client.rhino-project.org` would treat cookies issued by the server at `server.rhino-project.org` as a first-party cookie. [See reference.](https://www.cookiepro.com/knowledge/whats-the-difference-between-first-and-third-party-cookies/#:~:text=The%20main%20differences%20between%20first,loaded%20on%20the%20publisher's%20website.)

Third-party cookie are often used for advertisement purposes and are related to many privacy issues, so browsers are constantly restricting their use. [Chrome's Incognito mode and Brave now just block them completely.](https://venturebeat.com/2020/05/19/google-chrome-83/#:~:text=In%20Incognito%20mode%2C%20Chrome%20doesn,icon%20in%20the%20address%20bar.)

### SameSite attribute

This is an important attribute that can restrict cookies usage even more. For an API, however, they need to be more relaxed, so `SameSite=None` is currently the used setting. Read more about SameSite definition in [here](https://web.dev/samesite-cookies-explained/) and in this [issue](https://github.com/google/google-api-javascript-client/issues/561).

Rhino Server also sets these cookies to be secure, meaning they can only be served through a https connection. Due to recent changes and restrictions to cookies,

### Domain restriction

In a regular API backend + SPA frontend setup, client and server often live in different subdomains of a same domain. This could lead to server cookies being treated as third-party, but it’s possible to make them behave as first-party. Currently, cookie's `domain` attribute is not set by Rhino Server, as per the [OWASP guide](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html#domain-and-path-attributes). The guide states that it is the most restrictive, therefore safe, way. Theoretically, it only send the cookies to the host that issued them. Other references:

### WARNING: Special domains

[Some domains](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/refs/heads/main/net/base/registry_controlled_domains/effective_tld_names.dat#12130) have a special treatment by browsers - cookies are always treated as 3rd-party when issued by a different subdomain, even though the domain is the same. For instance, a browser running `client-test.herokuapp.com` would treat as 3rd-party any cookies emitted by `server-test.herokuapp.com`, because the domain is `herokuapp.com` and it has a special treatment as per the link.
